        Myopia, is a condition of the eye where light focuses in front, instead of on the retina. <br/> <br/>
        This causes distant objects to be blurry while close objects appear normal. <br/> <br/>
         Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain.
         Severe near-sightedness increases the risk of retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.

        Far-sightedness, also known as hyperopia, is a condition of the eye where light focuses behind,
         instead of on, the retina.<br/> <br/>

         This causes close objects to be blurry while far objects may appear normal.Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. <br/> <br/>

         People with hyperopia can also experience accommodative dysfunction, binocular dysfunction,amblyopia, and strabismus.

        Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color. <br/> <br/>

        People with total color blindness may also have decreased visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments. <br/> <br/>

        The most common cause of color blindness is due to a fault in the development of one or more of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye.

        Amsler grid, is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines used to monitor a person\'s central visual field. <br/> <br/>

        It is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina,
        particularly the macula, as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain.

        Visual acuity (VA) commonly refers to the clarity of vision. Visual acuity is dependent on optical and neural factors, i.e., <br/> <br/>
         (i) the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye, <br/> <br/>
         (ii) the health and functioning of the retina, and <br/> <br/>
         (iii) the sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain.
